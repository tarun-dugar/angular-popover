Demo

  http://tarun-dugar.github.io/ng-popover/  

Features
-----------
A simple AngularJS(1.x) directive which creates a simple but fully customizable popover. Options:

  1. Use an external template or just a string for the popover content.
  2. Open the popover using either a click or mouseover.
  3. Specify the direction of the popover - top, bottom, left, right.
  4. Decide whether you want to close the popover by click or when the mouse cursor leaves the popover area.
  5. Comes with a box shadow, a triangular tip and a floating effect.

Usage
-----
  1. Include angular-popover.js(or min.js) after loading AngularJS.
  2. Include angular-popover.css. 
  3. Add the angular-popover module to your project:
  
    ```javascript
    var app = angular.module('yourModuleName', ['angular-popover'])
    ```
  4. Add the angular-popover directive along with multiple attributes:
  
    ```html
    <div angular-popover direction="top" template="hey there!">
    ```
  5. **IMPORTANT**: Keep in mind, the 'position' property of the element to which the directive is applied will be set to 'relative' if the current value of 'position' is 'static'.  

Options
-------
###template
Use the template attribute when you just want to add some text inside the popover. This avoids the hassle of creating an external template everytime.

###template-url
When you want to load the popover with an external template, set template-url to the path of your template.

###mode
Decide on what event you want the popover to open - `load` or `click` or `mouseover`. If not specified, the click event will be used.

###close-on-click
It is not working if the mode is load.
Set close-on-click to `true` if you want the popover to close. If not set, the popover closes on click only if the mode is click. 

###close-on-mouseleave
It is not working if the mode is load.
Set close-on-mouseleave to `true` if you want the popover to close. If not set, the popover closes on mouseleave only if the mode is mouseover. 

###padding
Set the padding for the popover content just like in CSS.

###background-color
Set the background-color of the popover.

###text-color
Set the color of the text in the popover.
